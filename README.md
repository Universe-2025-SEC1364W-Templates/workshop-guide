# Secure more, stress less with a risk-based rollout of GitHub Advanced Security

## Session Summary
Regulators, customers, and auditors are raising the bar on software security — and organizations need to prove they have the right controls in place, without slowing down innovation.

In this interactive workshop, you'll jump into action to help "Acme Corp” recover from a breach by rolling out GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) using a risk-based approach. You'll work inside a live GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) organization to classify repositories by risk, apply the right security configurations, and automate governance with organization-wide rulesets.

You'll also see how this practical playbook helps you meet compliance requirements for frameworks like NIST SSDF, CRA, and SLSA — all while keeping your developers moving fast and focused on what they do best: building great software.

## Key Takeaways

- Learn how to manage a risk-based rollout of GHAS across your organization  
- Discover how to meet compliance requirements without slowing down your developers  
- See how to satisfy frameworks like NIST SSDF, CRA, and SLSA in under two hours
